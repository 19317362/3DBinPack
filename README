This is a slight modification to the classic bin packing algorithm.  Instead of having a finite 
set of boxes that need to be packed it assumes a bin, a given box and figures out how
many boxes  of that size fit in the bin

I used it for figuring how to cut material with least amount of waste

run it:

groovy pack3d.groovy 5,5,5 1,1,1
java pack3d 5,5,5 1,1,1
./pack3d 5,5,5 1,1,1

some benchmarks:

for 50 x 50 x 50 and you want 2 x 2 x 2

groovy: 325 ms
java: 10 ms
c:  2 ms

for larger 500,500,500 and you want 2 x 2 x 2

groovy: (NA too freaking slow to measure)
java: 5198 ms
c: 1162 ms
